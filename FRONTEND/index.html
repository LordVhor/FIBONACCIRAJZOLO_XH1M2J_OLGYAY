    <h1>Fibonacci sequence</h1>
    <p>The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each term is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting with 0 and 1. 
         This gives the sequence: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, and so on. 
         Named after the Italian mathematician Leonardo of Pisa (known as Fibonacci),
         the sequence appears in many natural phenomena, such as the arrangement of leaves on a stem,
         the pattern of pine cones, or the spirals of shells. Mathematically, it has deep connections to the golden ratio,
         as the ratio between successive Fibonacci numbers approximates this irrational number more closely as the sequence progresses.
